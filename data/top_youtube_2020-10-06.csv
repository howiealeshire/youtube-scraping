I talk a lot about the ordinary‚Äôs now iconic peeling solution and a lot of the comments on these videos seem to have this idea that I hate the ordinary now, especially as I no longer talk about a lot of the products I used to talk about non stop from them.

But the truth is, I‚Äôve just moved on to what I consider nicer products and nicer formulations. 

So today I want to discuss the products that I used to love from the ordinary, why I don‚Äôt use them anymore and the products I prefer.

Before we get into it though, the ordinary is still an amazing brand, and just because I prefer other products, doesn‚Äôt mean they are better than what the ordinary has to offer. The ordinary is an iconic brand for a reason, good quality products that actually work at an amazing price point. 
And I‚Äôd recommend the ordinary to anyone who wants amazing skincare on a budget, or just in general. 

I will pre-warn a lot of the alternatives will be more expensive because‚Ä¶.what brand isn‚Äôt more expensive than the ordinary!?
