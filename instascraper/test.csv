Elk call to each other. In this case, the bull is calling to the cows in his group to keep them together—and away from
competing males.

On this beautiful morning in mid-October, a hundred or more people braved the narrow, winding dirt road that leads into the valley to the herd. Great herds of elk used to be common in the eastern United States, but since the mid-1800s, their only remnants were names: Elkmont, Banner Elk, the Elk River— where I live in Tennessee. 

Elk are enormous; a bull can weigh over 700 pounds (300 kg). It is hard to appreciate how vast a project reintroducing a huge animal into its original habitat is. Bringing elk back to
the Smoky Mountains National Park took 10 years of study across the federal, state, and local levels, culminating in 2001, when the first 25 animals were reintroduced. Today the herd has grown to almost 200. 

Seeing and hearing them is a visceral experience. People flock to this part of the park just for a glimpse of these magnificent animals.

I found them living in miserable, inhumane conditions: some sheltered in dug-out holes meant for livestock, others squatted in abandoned train cars and industrial ruins of factories. In Azerbaijani language, ""qaçqın"" (refugee) became widely synonymous with ""poor"" and ""dejected."" As two decades went by, new generations of children were born into the limbo of muffled hopes that one day they’d be able to return home. For these vulnerable communities pushed to the margins of society, the pain of being uprooted by conflict became a deeply entrenched trauma that passed on to the next generations. 

I hope that the end of hostilities in Nagorno-Karabakh will evolve into a sustained and lasting peace that will give both sides displaced by this conflict a chance to go home and rebuild their lives. It will take years before they can rehabilitate physically and emotionally from these traumatic events. I am Azerbaijani, and it’s been very disturbing for me to observe thousands of Armenians fleeing Nagorno-Karabakh over the past month. I don’t wish them the same fate of the Azerbaijani refugees I had photographed. 

For generations, Azerbaijanis and Armenians have been living in peace side by side. But fueled by our respective identity crisis, this smoldering conflict is a product of two opposing nationalist narratives constructed and fed to us over the years. These narratives are damaging to our human psyche and our ability to co-exist peacefully. I hope the day will come when we can see each other not as two warring ethnicities, but as humans: friends, neighbors, business partners, relatives, just the way we used to be in the past. #Azerbaijan #Armenia #NKpeace",Experience the world through the eyes of National Geographic photographers.,,146123647,https://on.natgeo.com/instagram

Mountain goats can jump almost 12 feet (4m), and they're more closely related to antelopes than actual goats. These sure-footed creatures love salt and will travel miles to enjoy a natural salt deposit. Some will even follow hikers to lick salt from the urine they leave behind.

Isn’t it strange then that giraffes are in some ways incredibly overlooked? The drastic decline in their population numbers didn’t receive global attention until only recently, prompting references to their ""silent extinction."" And despite how familiar that unmistakable long-necked shape may seem to us, so many aspects of giraffe lives and behavior remain a mystery, or have been long misunderstood. Compared to other African icons, such as elephants, rhinos, or lions, giraffes have been surprisingly understudied. It’s not easy to safeguard a creature we don’t really understand … so it’s more important than ever that we pay giraffes more attention. #giraffes #conservation #endangeredspecies",,,,

It marked the integration of schools in her native New Orleans and became an iconic depiction of desegregation in America. I had the privilege of taking this portrait for a profile in the magazine of her incredible life story and continued work. The morning of our shoot, temperatures in New Orleans soared and the air conditioning in our studio died, right on cue. My assistant scrambled to find a portable unit that arrived only moments before Ms. Bridges and barely kept the temperatures inside tolerable. She was completely un-phased by the sauna she stepped into, and looking back at these pictures now, I'm struck by her effortless joy.",,,,

Here, Andy shares a moment with his horse in Montana. Right now, nature has sent us a strong message and reminded all of us of just how small and deeply interconnected our world is. It is a powerful moment to reimagine our relationship to nature and to one other. When we see ourselves as part of the landscape and part of nature, then we recognize that saving nature is really about saving ourselves. Our fates are linked.

Planet Earth is the only home we have, and I want everyone to experience and benefit from the diversity of habitat and life in all of its forms—from glaciers to deserts, elephants to the tiniest of ants. What happens next is in all of our hands: Our actions today determine the future for generations after us. Nature is resilient if we give it a chance, and we owe it to future generations to give it that chance.
